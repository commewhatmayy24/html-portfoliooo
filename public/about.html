<p>My name is Ojaswita. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from GLA University, Mathura. </br> I am in my second year and have a keen interest in programming, particularly in java. I have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, which I am currently enhancing through my coursework. </br> I am also exploring the world of web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively participating in coding competitions and hackathons to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I enjoy solving complex problems and am always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks that can help me grow as a developer. </br> I am currently working on a project that involves building a movie ranking application, where users can rate and review their favorite films. This project not only allows me to apply my programming skills but also gives me the opportunity to explore user interface design and user experience principles.</p>


Alongside my technical studies, I am learning web development through Angelina's course.</br> I am passionate about coding and love working on tasks that challenge me mentally. </br>Apart from technology, I am deeply into dance, literature, and creative arts. I love diving into the ocean of words, exploring both Hindi and English literature, and expanding my vocabulary. My interest in storytelling and literature also inspires me to create content and concepts for movies. I believe in blending creativity with technology and constantly pushing my limits to grow in both fields.</p>
